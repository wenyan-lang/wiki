## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10+

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
# install all the dependencies
npm i
```

### Commonly used NPM scripts
```bash
# watch and auto re-build code into dist
$ npm run dev

# watch and auto re-build code for online ide
$ npm run dev:site

# directly run and test cli without building
$ npm run cli

# build all dist files, including npm packages
$ npm run build

# run the full test suite, including linting/type checking
$ npm test
```

There are some other scripts available in the scripts section of the `package.json` file.

**Please make sure to have tests pass successfully before submitting a PR**. Although the same tests will be run against your PR on the CI server, it is better to have it working locally.
