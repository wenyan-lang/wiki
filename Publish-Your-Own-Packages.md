By the following steps, your package is good to go!

- Create a git repo on Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket
- Commit your code and make sure `序.wy`(as an entry) in the root.
- Clone [the registry repo](https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wyg-registry) and modify the [`registry.yml`](https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wyg-registry/blob/master/registry.yml) file to add your package info. The details are included in the file as comments.
- Create a PR for your changes.
- Wait for the PR to get merged. Once merged, people can access your package right through `wyg`!
